    <h1 class="head1">BEST TIME TO VISIT</h1>
    <p class="p1">Set amidst the rustic Aravalli mountain ranges and the golden-sandy Thar Desert,
        Rajasthan is indeed a place that is unparalleled and in it is true in its own right.
        Bordered by the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and
        the Pakistani provinces of Punjab and Sindh, Rajasthan holds many gems and secrets within
        its borders that have always managed to interest and draw tourists from different parts of India
        as well as from all over the world.</p>
    
        <p class="p1">From majestic forts, such as those of Amer and Mehrangarh, and significant religious attractions
            like the Dilwara Jain temples and Karni Mata temple, to spell-binding royal structures, such as
            the Umaid Bhawan palace, Rajasthan has it all. Comprising of both exotic destinations, such as
            Udaipur, Jaipur, Jodhpur, and Jaisalmer, as well as quaint, rural settings like that of Bundi and Alwar,
            the state of Rajasthan has something or the other to offer to all kinds of tourists.</p>

        <p class="p1">Despite being popular among tourists as the dessert-state of India, Rajasthan is rich in flora and fauna as well,
            as it also home to a plethora of national parks and wildlife sanctuaries that are located in the state.
            Home to peculiarities, such as the world’s oldest ploughing field, the nation’s largest district, and the oldest
            mountain range as well as colour coded cities, Rajasthan promises to exceed the expectations of all those who
            decide to visit it.
        </p>
        <p class="p1">The best time to visit Rajasthan will mostly depend on what you plan to do when you visit the state. While the
            summers are rather hot in Rajasthan, they may not be the best time to visit Rajasthan, as the temperatures may
            severely impact your sightseeing schedules, winters are generally considered to be the best season to visit Rajasthan.
            However, it all depends on what you plan to do and how much you can stand the heat. Some knowledge about what the temperature
            and weather is like during the year can help you in better planning your itinerary.
        </p>
        <h2 class="p1">Rajasthan during the different times of the year</h2>
        <p class="p1">Given its location and geography, the state of Rajasthan mainly experiences three seasons, those being - winters,
            monsoon, and  summer.
        </p>
        <p class="p1">Winters-The winters are marked as being the best season to visit Rajasthan. While various parts of India experience
            an extreme drop in temperatures and chilly weather, the princely state enjoys a mild weather with temperatures ranging
            between 10°C – 30°C for most parts. Winters in Rajasthan usually commence around October and extend to January.
            While it is nice and sunny during the day, it is mostly the nights that get chilly during this time of the year.
        </p>
        <p class="p1">
            Another significant reason that makes winters the best time to visit Rajasthan is the series of colourful and
            exciting fairs and festivals that take place in various cities. Some of the most popular festivals that the
            state is known for, including the Jaipur Literature Festival, Udaipur World Music Festival, Camel Fair, and
            Pushkar Fair, are observed during the winter season.
        </p>

        <p class="p1">So, visiting Rajasthan during the winters will enable you to witness the culture of Rajasthan a little 
            closely.
        </p>

        <p class="p1">Monsoons – The South-West Monsoon and Western Disturbances are the main causes of rainfall in Rajasthan. 
            The Aravalli range running across Rajasthan from Guru Shikhar in the south west to Khetri in the north east, 
            divides the state in a 60 by 40 ratio. So, while 60% of the state lies to the north west of the range, 
            40% of it lies to the south east. Lying parallel to the incoming southwest monsoon winds, the mountain range 
            fails to intercept them, resulting in a dry and sandy north west region. On the contrary, the eastern and 
            south eastern parts of Rajasthan are both better watered and more fertile. Rainfall in Rajasthan ranges in 
            between 100-165 mm during the monsoon season. The presence of impervious rocks in the western parts of 
            Rajasthan can also sometimes cause them to flood up.
        </p>

        <p class="p1">Visiting Rajasthan during the monsoon season, you will be welcomed by lush greenery, rainbows, and peacocks dancing
            around. You will also get to catch up on some cultural extravaganzas, as various parts of the state ready up for the
            Teej festival in the monsoon season.
        </p>

        <p class="p1">Summers – Summers in Rajasthan are usually hot and dry, with temperatures rising up to as high as 48 degrees Celsius.
            Scorching heat and high temperatures make things challenging for people here. Temperatures in areas around the Thar
            Desert are usually the harshest. However, summers in places like Mount Abu, Ranakpur, and Kumbhalgarh in Rajasthan,
            which are the places to which tourists mostly flock to when visiting the state in this season, are rather pleasant.
        </p>

        <p class="p1">For people who have a problem with extreme weather conditions, this might not be the best time to visit Rajasthan.
            However, if you plan on coming to Rajasthan during this time of the year, make sure that you bring along things like
            sunscreen and comfortable and light cotton clothes with you. It will also help save you from sunburns if these
            attires are full-sleeved.
